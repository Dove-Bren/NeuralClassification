\section{Overview}

\section{Hopfield Autoassociative Memory Network}
Our hopfield network was terrific! Type stuff here

\subsection{Image Encoding}
The image encoding... blah blah. Type here

\subsection{Performance}
Here is where we need to talk about how long it took and how good it was. We
also might want to mention the size limitations this introduced!

\subsection{Sensitivity}
This section is about how badly noise and the size disrupted our accuracy

\subsection{Comments}
It says "your own observation and conclusions about the experiment."
I'm thinking we talk generally about how it did (like a conclusion) and how
what we did ended up working.
